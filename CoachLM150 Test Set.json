Koda knew the outback like the back of his paw, and he quickly realized that the tourists were in trouble. Without hesitation, he offered to guide them back to the main road, using his keen sense of direction and his lightning-fast hops.\n\nThe tourists were grateful for Koda's help, and they followed him through the rugged and rocky terrain, marveling at his grace and strength. Koda led them safely back to the main road, where they could get help and find their way home.\n\nAs a reward for his kindness, the tourists gave Koda a small bag of carrots, which he happily accepted. Koda waved goodbye to the tourists and hopped off into the sunset, feeling proud and happy that he had been able to help someone in need.\n\nAnd from that day on, Koda became known as the kind and helpful kangaroo of the outback, always ready to lend a helping paw to those who needed it."

Without hesitation, Lila descended the stairs, eager to discover what lay below.\n\nAs she walked down the stairs, she heard the faint sound of music growing louder with each step. When she reached the bottom of the staircase, she found herself in a vast underground chamber, filled with colorful lights and the sweet melody of music. In the center of the chamber stood a magnificent crystal tree, its branches glittering in the light. Lila was awestruck by the beauty of the tree and the music that surrounded her. As she approached the tree, she noticed that there were small creatures dancing around it. They were fairies, with delicate wings and mischievous smiles.

During the shorter journey of sunlight, only a little of the blue color of the white light is scattered. Since light coming from the overhead sun has almost all its component colors in the right proportion, the sun in the sky overhead appears white to us. \nBut when the same sun is near the horizon at sunset, the sunlight has to travel the greatest distance through the atmosphere to reach us. During this long journey of sunlight, most of the shorter wavelength blue colour present in it is scattered out and away from our line of sight.
